# ESP8266_WAN-IP_-LOGGER
An Arduino project along with PHP scripts to fetch and store public IP addresses in a MySQL database. The Arduino code periodically retrieves the public IP address using the ipify API and sends it to a PHP script hosted on a server. The PHP script saves the IP address in the database and provides endpoints for fetching the stored IP addresses.
